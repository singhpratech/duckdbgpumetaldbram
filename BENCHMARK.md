## 2026-05-09 (late evening) — honest parallel CPU baseline + re-bench

The earlier CPU baseline was single-threaded `std::unordered_map`. That's not
a fair comparison to a 20-thread CPU. Replaced with a cardinality-aware switch:

- **Low cardinality** (`expected_groups <= n / 50`): per-thread map + merge
  (parallel; merge stays cheap because per-thread maps are small)
- **High cardinality** (otherwise): single-threaded
  (the per-thread-merge pattern collapses when per-thread maps approach the
  full output size — measured below)

This is exactly the kind of decision a hybrid CPU/GPU planner has to make.

### Synthetic: 50M int64 rows, varying cardinality, **honest CPU**

| Cardinality | CPU (mode)        | CUDA wall | CUDA kernel | Winner       |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
|        1,024 |  23.2 ms (parallel) |  86.2 ms |   8.7 ms | **CPU** by 3.7× wall  · CUDA kernel 2.6× |
|    1,000,000 | 1066.9 ms (serial)  |  88.7 ms |   6.5 ms | **CUDA** 12.0× wall · 164× kernel |
|   10,000,000 | 2321.0 ms (serial)  | 169.5 ms |  46.6 ms | **CUDA** 13.7× wall · 50× kernel |

### Why parallel CPU collapses at high cardinality

With 50M rows and 1M unique keys, each of 20 threads sees 2.5M rows hitting
~918K unique keys (per balls-and-bins). The merge phase becomes 19 sequential
merges of ~918K-entry maps into the largest one — about 18M hash-table
insertions on a hot 1M-entry table. Single-thread total: ~2.3 s; parallel
total in the older naive impl: ~10 s.

**Fix path** (out of scope for this PR): hash-partition the input rows by
`hash(key) % nthreads` so per-thread output domains are disjoint and the
merge becomes free `vector` concatenation. That's the standard radix-shuffle
pattern from VLDB literature (e.g. Balkesen et al. 2013).

### Implication for the planner

- For SUM/MIN/MAX (memory-bandwidth-bound): **CPU wins on cold data**;
  GPU wins only when data is resident. Threshold: column resident in VRAM.
- For GROUP BY:
  - `groups <= 100K`: **CPU wins**, even cold. PCIe transfer dominates GPU.
  - `groups > 100K`: **GPU wins** by 10×+ even with PCIe.
  - Threshold for the planner: estimated cardinality.

This is exactly the open problem from Rosenfeld/Breß CSUR 2022 and
the Cao SIGMOD 2024 finding that production GPU DBMSs leave perf on the
table by not making this decision well.

## 2026-05-09 (evening) — GROUP BY hash aggregate, 1.3×–21.8× CUDA win

First end-to-end SUM(value) GROUP BY key on RTX 4090 Laptop. Implementation:
open-addressing hash table on device, splitmix64 hashing, atomicCAS for slot
claim, atomicAdd for accumulation, separate compaction kernel.

CPU reference is single-threaded `std::unordered_map`. (A parallel CPU
implementation with per-thread maps + merge would close the gap somewhat
but still loses on high-cardinality, see below.)

### Synthetic: 50M int64 rows, varying cardinality

| Cardinality | CPU wall | CUDA wall (incl PCIe) | CUDA kernel | CUDA win (wall) | CUDA win (kernel) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1,024 groups       |  116 ms |  91 ms | 11.7 ms |  **1.3×** |  **9.9×** |
| 1,000,000 groups   | 1242 ms | 130 ms | 43.7 ms |  **9.6×** | **28.4×** |
| 10,000,000 groups  | 4099 ms | 188 ms |  52 ms  | **21.8×** | **78.9×** |

PCIe transfer is constant ~79 ms regardless of cardinality (it's the input
data, not the output). Kernel time grows sublinearly with cardinality
because the hash table fits in HBM and probe chains stay short at load
factor < 0.5.

### TPC-H SF1 lineitem.l_orderkey (6M rows → 1.5M unique groups)

| Backend | wall (ms) | kernel (ms) | xfer (ms) | input throughput |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| CPU (single-threaded unordered_map) | 81.7 | — | — | 1.09 GiB/s |
| **CUDA** | **16.9** | 2.3 | 10.4 | **5.31 GiB/s (kernel 38.7 GiB/s)** |

**4.8× faster end-to-end**, on real TPC-H data, including PCIe transfer.

### Why GROUP BY is fundamentally different from SUM

SUM is memory-bound on both CPU and GPU. CPU saturates DDR5; GPU has to
overcome PCIe transfer. SUM only wins on resident data.

GROUP BY is memory-LATENCY bound on CPU (`unordered_map` does pointer
chasing on every probe; cache misses dominate at high cardinality).
On GPU, atomic ops on HBM are 10-100× faster per probe, and warps fully
hide latency. So GPU wins even with PCIe transfer added — the CPU is just
slow enough that the comparison is no longer close.

This is why every academic GPU OLAP paper since 2018 leads with hash join
and GROUP BY benchmarks, not scan-based aggregation.

### What this means for the project
- The "hot resident column" pattern is critical for SUM-class operators.
- GROUP BY-class operators win cold too — they're the foundation of any
  GPU OLAP value proposition.
- Next operator to attack: **hash join probe** (same data structure shape,
  bigger payoff because joins dominate TPC-H query times).

## 2026-05-09 (afternoon) — resident-column SUM beats CPU 17-24× on real TPC-H

The point of this run: prove that the architecture wins when transfer cost is amortized across multiple queries against the same column.

### Workload 1: TPC-H SF1 `lineitem.l_orderkey` (6,001,215 int64 rows, 45.8 MiB)

| Backend / mode | wall (ms) | kernel (ms) | xfer (ms) | throughput | vs CPU |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| CPU 20-thread OpenMP | 0.68 | — | — | 65.63 GiB/s | 1× |
| CUDA cold (per-call upload) | 4.93 | 0.033 | 4.87 | 9.07 GiB/s | 0.14× — loses |
| **CUDA hot (resident, kernel only)** | **0.038** | **0.029** | 0 | **1187 GiB/s** | **17.9×** |
| CUDA kernel-only throughput | — | 0.029 | — | **1547 GiB/s** | 23.5× |

### Workload 2: TPC-H SF1 `lineitem.l_extendedprice` (6M f64, 45.8 MiB)

| Backend / mode | wall (ms) | kernel (ms) | xfer (ms) | throughput | vs CPU |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| CPU | 2.07 | — | — | 21.66 GiB/s | 1× |
| CUDA cold | 5.00 | 0.074 | 4.89 | 8.94 GiB/s | 0.41× |
| **CUDA hot** | **0.085** | 0.076 | 0 | **526 GiB/s** | **24×** |

### Workload 3: synthetic 200M int64 (1.5 GiB) — beyond DDR5 working-set

| Backend / mode | wall (ms) | xfer (ms) | throughput | vs CPU |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| CPU | 65.1 | — | 22.9 GiB/s | 1× |
| CUDA cold | 161.6 | 158.7 | 9.2 GiB/s | 0.35× |
| **CUDA hot** | **2.85** | 0 | **522 GiB/s** | **22.8×** |

### What this proves

1. **PCIe wall is real.** Cold GPU underperforms CPU by 3–7× on every workload tested. 98 % of cold time is host→device transfer.
2. **GPU wins decisively when data is resident.** 17–24× over a 20-thread CPU running OpenMP at near-DDR5 saturation, on real TPC-H data.
3. **Kernel throughput approaches HBM-class numbers.** 1547 GiB/s for int64 SUM on RTX 4090 Laptop (theoretical HBM2e on 4090 desktop ≈ 1008 GiB/s; the laptop's GDDR6 is lower, so we're near the bandwidth ceiling).
4. **The Sirius/Crystal thesis is reproduced on commodity hardware**: GPU databases must keep data resident across many queries. One-shot uploads always lose.

### Implication for the project
Build operators that *assume residency*. The user-facing API has to look like:
```cpp
auto col = engine.cache(parquet_path, "lineitem.l_quantity");
engine.sum(col); engine.min(col); engine.max(col); engine.group_by(col, ...);
```
i.e. amortize the upload across many SQL queries. This is exactly Sirius's design and exactly what cuDF gets right.

## 2026-05-09 (morning) — first CUDA vs CPU SUM, RTX 4090 Laptop

**Hardware**
- CPU: 20-thread x86_64 (Linux Mint 22.3 / Ubuntu 24.04 base)
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop, sm_89, 15.6 GiB VRAM
- Driver 580.142, CUDA Toolkit 13.0.88
- Memory: DDR5 (CPU baseline saturates ~54 GiB/s — close to dual-channel theoretical)
- PCIe: Gen4 x16 (~32 GiB/s theoretical, observed effective ≈ 10 GiB/s on these copies)

**Build**
- gcc 13.3.0, CMake 3.x, Release, OpenMP enabled
- Two-pass tree reduction, 256 threads/block, grid-stride load
- No CUB/Thrust dependency yet (hand-rolled kernel)

**Workload**
- 100,000,000 int64 elements (762 MiB), uniform random in [-1e6, +1e6]
- Operation: SUM
- 5 runs, median reported

**Result**
| Backend | wall (ms) | kernel (ms) | transfer H2D (ms) | wall throughput | kernel throughput |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| CPU (20 thread OpenMP) | 13.76 | n/a | n/a | 54.16 GiB/s | — |
| CUDA — total | 80.63 | 1.44 | 79.17 | 9.24 GiB/s | — |
| CUDA — kernel only | — | **1.44** | — | — | **517.29 GiB/s** |

**Interpretation**
- **The PCIe wall is real** on this hardware. 98 % of CUDA wall time is host→device transfer.
- **The GPU kernel is 9.5× faster** than the CPU once data is resident.
- This reproduces the Shanbhag/Madden/Yu (Crystal, SIGMOD 2020) finding that GPU-as-coprocessor with cold data underperforms CPU; only GPU-resident workloads win.

**What this tells us about the project direction**
- Single-shot SUM on cold data is the wrong workload to optimize.
- Real wins require: (a) data already resident in VRAM (multiple queries per load), (b) NVLink/GH200 unified memory, or (c) Apple Silicon UMA (no transfer).
- Next step: implement a workload that amortizes transfer — e.g. multiple aggregations on the same column, or a hash group-by where the GPU stays "hot" across many queries.

## 2026-05-09 — CPU baseline, smaller workload (sanity check)

50M int64 SUM, 5 runs:
- CPU 6.72 ms → 55.46 GiB/s
- CUDA: not yet run (was CPU-only build at the time)

10M int64 SUM from disk file (`data/synth_10M_i64.gpudb`), 5 runs:
- CPU 1.43 ms → 51.95 GiB/s
